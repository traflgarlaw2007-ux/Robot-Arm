# 🤖 Assembled Robot Arm Project

This repository documents an **assembled robotic arm**, including its mechanical structure, electronics, and basic control setup.  
The project is intended for **learning, experimentation, and further development** in robotics, automation, and mechatronics.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The robot arm is a multi-degree-of-freedom (DOF) articulated arm designed to demonstrate:
- Joint motion and kinematics
- Basic manipulation tasks (pick & place, positioning)

---

## 🧩 Features

- Fully **assembled mechanical structure**
- Modular design for easy upgrades
- Suitable for **education, prototyping, and research**

---

## 🛠️ Hardware Components

- Robot arm mechanical kit (links + joints)
- Power supply (external recommended)
- End-effector (gripper)

> ⚠️ Exact components may vary depending on configuration.



## 🧪 Applications

- Robotics education
- Pick and place demonstrations
- Motion control experiments
- ROS learning platform
- Mechatronics projects
